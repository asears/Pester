function BeforeEach {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Defines a series of steps to perform at the beginning of every It block within
        the current Context or Describe block.

    .DESCRIPTION
        BeforeEach, AfterEach, BeforeAll, and AfterAll are unique in that they apply
        to the entire Context or Describe block, regardless of the order of the
        statements in the Context or Describe.  For a full description of this
        behavior, as well as how multiple BeforeEach or AfterEach blocks interact
        with each other, please refer to the about_BeforeEach_AfterEach help file.
